#Sky Mining Event - Skyblock
###Server: MysticCraft

This plugin is a reward system that gives coins for Players while they mining in certain area.
These coins serve as a form of payment in purchases made in the system market.
The Market can be accessed by the commando "/mercado".

The coins are just dropped in the official mine of the server, located at the "/mina".
These coins can be traded between players whichever way you prefer.
